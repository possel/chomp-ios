Chomp ðŸ’¬
=====

iOS client for Possel. Still pretty rough around the edges and largely experimental.

# Building

This project uses Bundler and CocoaPods for pretty easy setup and running.

* Make sure an appropriate Ruby version is installed
 * Example: `rbenv local 2.0.0-p576`
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec pod install`
* `open Chomp.xcworkspace`
